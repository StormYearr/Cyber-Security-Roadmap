# 🛡️ Room: Defensive Security Intro (TryHackMe)

This room explores the "Blue Team" perspective, focusing on how organizations protect their assets, detect intrusions, and respond to cyber attacks.



## 📝 Key Areas of Defensive Security

### 1. Security Operations Center (SOC)
The SOC is the central team responsible for monitoring a network 24/7. 
* **Focus:** Vulnerabilities, Policy Violations, Unauthorized Activity, and Network Intrusions.
* **Threat Intelligence:** Gathering data about adversaries (Threat Actors) to achieve a threat-informed defense.

### 2. Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
* **Digital Forensics:** The science of investigating digital crimes by analyzing File Systems, System Memory, and Logs.
* **Incident Response:** The methodology used to handle a breach.
    * **Phases:** Preparation -> Detection & Analysis -> Containment, Eradication & Recovery -> Post-Incident Activity.

### 3. Malware Analysis
Analyzing malicious software to understand its behavior.
* **Static Analysis:** Inspecting code (Assembly) without executing it.
* **Dynamic Analysis:** Running the malware in a controlled "sandbox" environment to observe its actions.

## 🛠 Tool Highlight: SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
In this room, I interacted with a simulated **SIEM**. A SIEM is the "brain" of a SOC, collecting logs from various sources and presenting them in a single dashboard.

**Key SIEM Capabilities:**
- **Log Aggregation:** Gathering data from firewalls, servers, and databases.
- **Alerting:** Generating notifications when suspicious patterns (e.g., multiple failed logins) are detected.
- **Correlation:** Linking different events to identify a complex attack.

## 🚀 Hands-on Lab: SIEM Simulation (Write-up)

### Scenario
I acted as a SOC Analyst for a bank, monitoring alerts generated by the SIEM.

### Investigation Steps
1. **Analyze Alerts:** I reviewed a list of alerts, including failed login attempts and connections from unauthorized IP addresses.
2. **Identify Malicious Activity:** While some alerts were false positives (forgotten passwords), I identified a specific intrusion attempt.
3. **Trace the IP:** I investigated the source IP and the target account/system.
4. **Conclusion:** By following the investigative steps provided in the simulation, I successfully mitigated the threat and retrieved the flag.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned
* **Prevention vs. Detection:** Defense is not just about building walls (Firewalls); it's about knowing when someone is trying to climb over them (Monitoring).
* **Malware Diversity:** Learned the differences between **Viruses** (self-spreading), **Trojans** (hidden malicious functions), and **Ransomware** (encryption for profit).
* **The Importance of Evidence:** Digital forensics is crucial for understanding *how* a hacker got in, which is essential for preventing future incidents.
